# 🎰 Slot Machine Simulation  

This project is a **simple slot machine simulator** built for learning and experimentation.  
It does **not involve real money or gambling** – the purpose is purely educational, to understand how a slot machine works at a basic level.  

✨ Features  
- Simulates spinning reels with symbols  
- Basic win/lose logic (matches on reels)  
- Configurable number of spins and reels  
- Console-based interface for simplicity  

🛠️ Tech / Concepts Covered  
- Random number generation (`random` library)  
- Loops and conditional logic  
- Simple game mechanics  
- (Optional: GUI, if you added one)  

🚫 Disclaimer  
This project is **not intended for gambling or promoting gambling**.  
It’s just a coding exercise to demonstrate how probability and randomness can be implemented in a game-like system.
